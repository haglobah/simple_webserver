# SimpleWebserver

This is a tutorial project for learning to program with Elixir.

In this tutorial, you will build a working _web server_.

First, some of terminology to get out of the way:

- A _web server_ is a program that runs forevers, ingests HTTP (_HyperText Transfer Protocol_) requests and responds to them with a HTTP response.
- A _web browser_ (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Edge) is a program that sends HTTP requests to web servers and displays HTTP responses.

So whatever we do, we should be able to check our work with a web browser.
